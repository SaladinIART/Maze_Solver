Maze_Solver

Overview
--------
This project is a hands-on exploration of fundamental pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A Search*, brought to life through Pygame visualizations. The implementation is designed to demonstrate how these algorithms traverse a maze to find the optimal path from a starting point to a goal.

This repository serves as a compilation of case studies on pathfinding, illustrating how these algorithms operate in real-world scenarios that are crucial in fields like robotics and AI navigation.

Features
--------
  * Visual Maze Solver: The algorithms are visualized using Pygame, showing the traversal process in real time.
  * Multiple Algorithms: Users can explore BFS, DFS, and A* Search, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each.
  * Interactive Experience: Users can easily run the project and experiment with different maze configurations.

Getting Started
---------------
This section will guide you through setting up the Maze Solver project on your local machine to get it running.

Installation
------------
To run this project, ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/SaladinIART/Maze_Solver.git
cd Maze_Solver

3. Install Dependencies: Use pip to install Pygame:
pip install pygame
All dependencies will be installed automatically.

Usage Instructions
------------------
Once the dependencies are installed, the project can be run using the following steps:

Open a Terminal: Navigate to the project directory.
* Run the Main Script:
  python Maze_Solver_v1.31.py

3. Keyboard Controls:
  * Press B to run Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  * Press D to run Depth-First Search (DFS).
  * Press A to run A Search*.

4. Maze Visualization: The maze will be displayed, and the selected algorithm will begin solving it, visualizing the traversal in real time.

Algorithm Explanations
----------------------
  1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Description: BFS explores the maze level by level, ensuring that the shortest path is found. It uses a queue to manage the nodes.
    * Strengths: Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted maze.
    * Weaknesses: Can be memory-intensive for large mazes.

  3. Depth-First Search (DFS)
    * Description: DFS dives deep into paths before backtracking, using a stack structure.
    * Strengths: Memory-efficient compared to BFS.
    * Weaknesses: Does not guarantee the shortest path; may explore inefficient routes.
  
  4. A* Search
    * Description: A* uses a heuristic (such as the Manhattan distance) to guide the search, balancing efficiency and accuracy.
    * Strengths: Efficient for finding the shortest path in a weighted maze.
    * Weaknesses: Heuristic choice can impact performance.

File Descriptions
-----------------
  * Basic_map.py: Contains basic maze configurations.
  * Maze_Solver_v1.31.py: Main script for running the maze-solving algorithms.
  * Maze_Reconfigure.py: Script for experimenting with different maze setups.
  * map_generator.py: Utility for generating random maze maps.

Future Improvements
-------------------
  * Enhanced Heuristics: Experimenting with different heuristics to improve A* performance.
